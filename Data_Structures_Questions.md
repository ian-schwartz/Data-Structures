    0(1)

7. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_tail`?

    0(1)

8. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_front`?

    0(1)

9. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_end`?

    0(1)

    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the JS `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?

    Doubly linked list's delete method performs better because it is 0(1) while the worst-case runtime of the Array.splice method is 0(n) because it has to shift each item over.
